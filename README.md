			The Applied Policing and Crime Resolution fields outlined within NATED and NCV programs are rich in analytical techniques that intertwine calculus for precise applications. Let's integrate advanced calculations relevant to these topics and explore their experimental implications.																													
			Advanced Calculations in Applied Policing and Crime Resolution																													
			1. Evidence Decay Over Time Using Exponential Models																													
			Physical evidence, such as DNA or chemical residues, decays over time, which can be modeled using exponential decay:																													
																																
			C(t)=C0e−λt,C(t) = C_0 e^{-\lambda t},																													
			where:																													
			· C(t)C(t): Concentration of evidence at time tt,																													
			· C0C_0: Initial concentration,																													
			· λ\lambda: Decay constant.																													
																																
			1. Concentration after 10 days:																													
																																
			C(10)=100e−0.02⋅10=100e−0.2≈81.87 ng.C(10) = 100 e^{-0.02 \cdot 10} = 100 e^{-0.2} \approx 81.87 \, \text{ng}.																													
			2. Projectile Motion in Ballistic Analysis																													
			When investigating a shooting, the path of a projectile can be modeled by:																													
																																
			y=xtan⁡θ−gx22v2cos⁡2θ,y = x \tan \theta - \frac{g x^2}{2 v^2 \cos^2 \theta},																													
			where:																													
			· yy: Vertical displacement,

			· θ\theta: Firing angle,																													
			· vv: Initial velocity,																													
			· gg: Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s29.8 \, \text{m/s}^2).																													
			Example: Given v=500 m/sv = 500 \, \text{m/s}, θ=30∘\theta = 30^\circ, and x=100 mx = 100 \, \text{m}:																													
			1. Height (yy):																													
																																
			y=100tan⁡30∘−9.8⋅10022⋅5002⋅cos⁡230∘.y = 100 \tan 30^\circ - \frac{9.8 \cdot 100^2}{2 \cdot 500^2 \cdot \cos^2 30^\circ}.																													
			2. Compute:

			3. Area Estimation for Crime Scene Management																													
			Using calculus, calculate the area of irregular crime scene perimeters. Divide the boundary into segments described by functions, and integrate:																													
																																
			A=∫x1x2y(x) dx.A = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} y(x) \, dx.																													
			Example: For a boundary described by y(x)=x2+2y(x) = x^2 + 2 between x=0x = 0 and x=3x = 3:																													
			1. Compute area:																													
																																
			A=∫03(x2+2) dx=[x33+2x]03.A = \int_0^3 (x^2 + 2) \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3} + 2x\right]_0^3.																													
			2. Result:																													
																																
			A=(273+6)−0=15 m2.A = \left(\frac{27}{3} + 6\right) - 0 = 15 \, \text{m}^2.																													
			4. Surveillance Analysis Using Camera Rotation																													
			The angular velocity of a surveillance camera can be modeled as:																													
																																
			θ(t)=ωt+12αt2,\theta(t) = \omega t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2,																													
			where:																													
			· θ(t)\theta(t): Angle rotated,																													
			· ω\omega: Initial angular velocity,																													
			· α\alpha: Angular acceleration.																													
			Example: If ω=0.5 rad/s\omega = 0.5 \, \text{rad/s}, α=0.1 rad/s2\alpha = 0.1 \, \text{rad/s}^2, find the angle after t=10 st = 10 \, \text{s}:																													
																																
			θ(10)=0.5⋅10+12⋅0.1⋅102=5+5=10 rad.\theta(10) = 0.5 \cdot 10 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.1 \cdot 10^2 = 5 + 5 = 10 \, \text{rad}.																													
			5. Predictive Analytics for Crime Prevention																													
			Using linear regression to predict crime patterns:																													
																																
			y=mx+b,y = mx + b,																													
			where:																													
			· yy: Predicted crime rate,																													
			· xx: Variable (e.g., population density),																													
			· mm: Slope of the trendline,																													
			· bb: Intercept.																													
			Example: If m=0.02 crimes/personm = 0.02 \, \text{crimes/person}, b=10b = 10:																													
			1. For x=1000x = 1000:																													
																																
			y=0.02⋅1000+10=30 crimes.y = 0.02 \cdot 1000 + 10 = 30 \, \text{crimes}.

			The right to engage in peaceful demonstration 																													
																																
			is a cornerstone of American democracy. Yet 																													
																																
			sometimes police fail to strike the right balance, 																													
																																
			approaching demonstrations as a threat to 																													
																																
			public safety, rather than as an expression of 																													
																																
			constitutionally protected rights. This results in 																													
																																
			bad outcomes, for protestors and for police. 																													
																																
			This detailed guide provides an overview of how 																													
																																
			to police demonstrations to protect public 																													
																																
			safety and democratic freedoms. Drawn largely 																													
																																
			from what policing leaders themselves have 																													
																																
			identified as best practices as well as evidence																													
																																
			based research, it provides clear guidance to 																													
																																
			the police, and informs the public of what they 																													
																																
			should expect. A brief guide summarizing the 																													
																																
			key takeaways discussed here is also available. 																													
																																
			But first, an important caveat: any agency’s 																													
																																
			ability to successfully facilitate and de-escalate 																													
																																
			a demonstration will depend in large part on the 																													
																																
			relationship it has with the public before the 																													
																																
			event. Put simply, if an agency hasn’t earned the 																													
																																
			public’s trust with its everyday policing, it will 																													
																																
			struggle to de-escalate situations during a 																													
																																
			protest—even if it adheres to many of these best 																													
																																
			practices. We say this not to dissuade any 																													
																																
			agencies from implementing these strategies 																													
																																
			during a protest, but rather to emphasize the 																													
																																
			need to practice these principles consistently.

			individuals, and minors; 																													
																																
			1. Create a written policy for demonstrations 																													
																																
			Agencies should develop a mass demonstrations 																													
																																
			policy that emphasizes free expression, public 																													
																																
			safety, and de-escalation.³ This policy should 																													
																																
			incorporate public input on key concerns and 																													
																																
			insight from experts on policing, civil liberties, 																													
																																
			and human rights. In general, all agency policies 																													
																																
			should include the following provisions: 																													
																																
			An outline of the parameters and protections 																													
																																
			afforded journalists and legal observers, 																													
																																
			including the conditions under which they must 																													
																																
			be allowed to observe or monitor police 																													
																																
			conduct. 																													
																																
			Education: Instruct officers on their role as the 																													
																																
			facilitators and protectors of peaceful 																													
																																
			demonstrations. 																													
																																
			Emphasize 																													
																																
			constitutional 																													
																																
			rights and adherence to principles of 																													
																																
			procedural justice. Consider partnering with 																													
																																
			journalists and First Amendment legal experts 																													
																																
			to develop training modules on safeguarding 																													
																																
			journalists' and legal observers' rights at 																													
																																
			demonstrations. In addition, training modules 																													
																																
			should review the latest science on crowd 																													
																																
			psychology, which explains that crowds are 																													
																																
			not uniform and that officers are competing 																													
																																
			with agitators for protestors’ good will.⁴ 																													
																																
			De-escalation: Emphasize the importance of 																													
																																
			de-escalation tactics specific to the protest 																													
																																
			context, including strategies for handling 																													
																																
			antagonistic interpersonal interactions with 																													
																																
			large groups. Use scenario-based training to 																													
																																
			simulate high-stress protest environments. 																													
																																
			2. Train officers on this policy 																													
																																
			Following policy reform, training should be 																													
																																
			modified so that all officers are aware of the 																													
																																
			policy requirements. Key elements of training 																													
																																
			should include:

			⁴ POLICING PROTESTS, supra note 1 at 49-50. 																													
																																
			02Impact Weapons (i.e. batons): A baton or 																													
																																
			similar device may be authorized for use in a 																													
																																
			non-striking defensive capacity or to stop or 																													
																																
			neutralize a perceived threatening resistance 																													
																																
			(e.g., used in the two-hand horizontal thrust on 																													
																																
			a police line).⁵ Impact weapons should not be 																													
																																
			used for general crowd control, containment, 																													
																																
			or dispersal.⁶ Intentional baton strikes to the 																													
																																
			head, neck, throat, left armpit or clavicle are 																													
																																
			considered deadly force and may only be used 																													
																																
			when deadly force is authorized.⁷ Officers 																													
																																
			should be trained to avoid those areas of the 																													
																																
			body when using a baton. 																													
																																
			3. Restrict Use of Force 																													
																																
			Ensure that use of force is authorized only when 																													
																																
			there is a clear risk to personal safety or to restrain 																													
																																
			acts of property destruction or looting. Whenever 																													
																																
			reasonably possible, officers should give a verbal 																													
																																
			warning prior to any use of force. If authorized, 																													
																																
			officers must use only the minimum amount of 																													
																																
			force necessary and proportionate to de-escalate 																													
																																
			the situation. Once the situation is under control, 																													
																																
			officers who use force immediately should 																													
																																
			administer aid (if trained to do so) or request 																													
																																
			Emergency Medical Services (EMS). 																													
																																
			In addition, policy and practice should include 																													
																																
			clear restrictions on the use of impact weapons 																													
																																
			and chemical weapons, and should prohibit the 																													
																																
			use of distraction devices or impact projectiles to 																													
																																
			disperse crowds. Specifically: 																													
																																
			Pepper Spray: Pepper spray only may be 																													
																																
			used 																													
																																
			proportionately 																													
																																
			against 																													
																																
			specific 																													
																																
			individuals actively resisting arrest, or as 																													
																																
			necessary in a defensive capacity.⁸ It should 																													
																																
			not be used on people who are passively 																													
																																
			resisting, 																													
																																
			nor 																													
																																
			should 																													
																																
			it 																													
																																
			be 																													
																																
			sprayed 																													
																																
			indiscriminately over a large area as a means 																													
																																
			of crowd control. 																													
																																
			Firearms: when safe and feasible, officers 																													
																																
			should try to de-escalate situations, issue 																													
																																
			verbal warnings, or use non-lethal force with 																													
																																
			the goal of resolving encounters without using 																													
																																
			deadly force.⁹ Firearms almost never should 																													
																																
			be 																													
																																
			unholstered 																													
																																
			or 																													
																																
			used 																													
																																
			during 																													
																																
			a 																													
																																
			demonstration. Officers may use a firearm 																													
																																
			only when they reasonably believe such action 																													
																																
			is 																													
																																
			immediately 																													
																																
			necessary 																													
																																
			to 																													
																																
			protect 																													
																																
			themselves or another person from imminent 																													
																																
			danger of death or serious bodily harm.¹⁰ 																													
																																
			Vehicles: Officers should be prohibited from 																													
																																
			intentionally creating contact between their 																													
																																
			vehicles and protestors.¹¹ Intentional use of a 																													
																																
			vehicle at any speed to strike a protestor is 																													
																																
			considered deadly force.¹² Officers also 																													
																																
			should not drive through a demonstration area 																													
																																
			to reach a mobilization point or staging area. 																													
																																
			Helicopters: Helicopters should never be flown 																													
																																
			at low altitudes as a crowd dispersal tactic.

			Response plans should start "soft" with officers 																													
																																
			wearing regular uniforms and engaging the 																													
																																
			crowd while avoiding formations like lines or 																													
																																
			wedges. Demonstrate a commitment to 																													
																																
			facilitation by providing water or distributing 																													
																																
			face masks to protestors. 																													
																																
			All use of force incidents should be documented 																													
																																
			and reported. Accurately tracking and reporting 																													
																																
			officer-involved force incidents is critical to 																													
																																
			effectively managing a policing agency and 																													
																																
			maintaining the public’s trust. Admittedly, the 																													
																																
			potentially chaotic atmosphere of a protest 																													
																																
			presents significant challenges for documenting 																													
																																
			these incidents. Agencies should consider whether 																													
																																
			innovative options may be available to facilitate 																													
																																
			documentation. For example, agencies can require 																													
																																
			officers to report all uses of force live on police 																													
																																
			radio to ensure contemporaneous reporting or 																													
																																
			enable officers to report force incidents in a digital 																													
																																
			log on their agency smartphones. These live 																													
																																
			reporting methods provide a more efficient and 																													
																																
			user-friendly way to capture and track force 																													
																																
			incident data. 																													
																																
			4. Avoid an unnecessarily militarized 																													
																																
			presence or aggressive response 																													
																																
			Use tiered response plans that increase the level of 																													
																																
			engagement in proportion only to actual—not 																													
																																
			assumed or forecasted—conditions on the ground: 																													
																																
			Ensure that officers have ready access to 																													
																																
			helmets if needed to protect themselves 																													
																																
			from head injuries from projectiles or debris. 																													
																																
			Deploy officers in “hard” riot gear as a last 																													
																																
			resort, and only when necessary to protect 																													
																																
			the public or officers from violence or serious 																													
																																
			injury. In case of a violent outbreak, tactical 																													
																																
			units may be staged nearby but out of sight 																													
																																
			of protestors to avoid escalating a peaceful 																													
																																
			crowd. 																													
																																
			5. Ban the mass surveillance of protestors 																													
																																
			Police surveillance of protestors has a chilling 																													
																																
			effect on the constitutionally protected right to 																													
																																
			peacefully assemble. As such, agencies should 																													
																																
			ban the mass surveillance of protestors, 																													
																																
			particularly 																													
																																
			the 																													
																																
			use 																													
																																
			of 																													
																																
			controversial 																													
																																
			technologies, including facial recognition and 																													
																																
			social media surveillance. Use of drones or other 																													
																																
			aerial surveillance should be restricted to 																													
																																
			identifying specific outbreaks of violence or 																													
																																
			looting to enable targeted enforcement. Video 																													
																																
			feeds should not be recorded or stored. If 																													
																																
			protest activities are captured through existing 																													
																																
			surveillance systems, agencies should ensure that 																													
																																
			any resulting images or data are purged after a 																													
																																
			reasonable time period unless necessary to a 																													
																																
			felony investigation. 																													
																																
			Force & Surveillance6. Implement crowd management plans 																													
																																
			Early and comprehensive planning is essential to 																													
																																
			manage 																													
																																
			protests 																													
																																
			safely 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			effectively. 																													
																																
			Developing a clear strategy beforehand allows 																													
																																
			for informed and competent decision making 																													
																																
			during an event.¹³ Although today’s protests are 																													
																																
			often spontaneous and lack clear leaders, 																													
																																
			agencies still can prepare and train with general 																													
																																
			strategies and operational procedures that will 																													
																																
			guide the response to these flash events. 																													
																																
			When agencies receive advance notice of a 																													
																																
			protest, incident commanders (ICs) should 																													
																																
			prepare tailored, written plans that clearly 																													
																																
			communicate a strategy of facilitation and 																													
																																
			articulate 																													
																																
			officers’ 																													
																																
			specific 																													
																																
			roles 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			responsibilities.¹⁴ Plans should include education 																													
																																
			on the likely crowd subgroups and the issues 																													
																																
			behind the protest so that officers can 																													
																																
			understand and communicate with crowd 																													
																																
			members more effectively. They also should 																													
																																
			contemplate 																													
																																
			the 																													
																																
			need 																													
																																
			for 																													
																																
			inter-agency 																													
																																
			coordination prior to or during an event. For 																													
																																
			example, police may want to partner with the 																													
																																
			local sanitation agency to remove potential 																													
																																
			projectile or unintended barrier objects, such as 																													
																																
			trash cans or dumpsters, from demonstration 																													
																																
			sites.¹⁵ 																													
																																
			To address spontaneous events, ICs should 																													
																																
			prepare generic plans that cover different types 																													
																																
			and sizes of demonstrations to provide generally 																													
																																
			applicable strategic and tactical working 																													
																																
			principles. 																													
																																
			Operational 																													
																																
			plans 																													
																																
			should 																													
																																
			be 																													
																																
			distributed to all officers assigned to an event.¹⁶ 																													
																																
			7. Develop protocols for officer wellness 																													
																																
			Written protocols should be prepared to address 																													
																																
			officers’ physical and mental health needs during 																													
																																
			an event. This may include ensuring regular shift 																													
																																
			changes, arranging for adequate rest and 																													
																																
			hydration, and providing face masks.¹⁷ In addition, 																													
																																
			officers should receive specific preparation for the 																													
																																
			verbal assault they may encounter at protests, with 																													
																																
			mental health counseling provided for officers 																													
																																
			subject to traumatic interactions with protestors. 																													
																																
			8. Conduct outreach to organizers, informal 																													
																																
			leaders, and participants 																													
																																
			Agencies should conduct outreach to organizers of 																													
																																
			planned demonstrations or influential participants 																													
																																
			in spontaneous events identified through public 																													
																																
			sources, such as social media. Through this 																													
																																
			outreach, agencies should seek to facilitate 																													
																																
			cooperation and negotiate rules of engagement, 																													
																																
			including what type of behavior will result in what 																													
																																
			level of enforcement action. Police should 																													
																																
			approach these negotiations with a willingness to 																													
																																
			find a middle ground, rather than an expectation 																													
																																
			that all their demands must be met. Any 																													
																																
			negotiated terms should be communicated to the 																													
																																
			broader public through regular and social media. 																													
																																
			For informal protests or when event leaders are 																													
																																
			unwilling to meet with command staff in advance, 																													
																																
			agencies should publicize their rules of engagement 																													
																																
			via press conferences and social media to set clear 																													
																																
			expectations. Regardless of the response to their 																													
																																
			outreach, the police goal must remain to facilitate 																													
																																
			peaceful protest and protect public safety.

			05In general, policing protests about police does not 																													
																																
			require a separate set of best practices from policing 																													
																																
			other protests. Undoubtedly, this context presents 																													
																																
			unique challenges in planning and facilitation. For 																													
																																
			example, protest organizers may be less receptive to 																													
																																
			negotiating terms with police in advance, and 																													
																																
			protestors may display more antagonism toward 																													
																																
			officers.¹⁹ Because of these exact challenges, police 																													
																																
			must adhere even more stringently to the basic best 																													
																																
			practices set forth in this guide: commitment to 																													
																																
			facilitation 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			targeted 																													
																																
			enforcement.²⁰ 																													
																																
			These 																													
																																
			strategies 																													
																																
			promote 																													
																																
			de-escalation 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			create 																													
																																
			opportunities to humanize officers in the eyes of 																													
																																
			protestors. Some additional strategies specific to a 																													
																																
			protest about policing include: 																													
																																
			Dialogue Officers or Intermediary Officials: Consider 																													
																																
			using specially trained and attired officers (unarmed, 																													
																																
			casual clothing, 																													
																																
			reflective vests) to serve as 																													
																																
			intermediaries between command and protestors.²¹ 																													
																																
			Alternately, consider partnering with other local 																													
																																
			agencies or community or civil rights groups to serve in 																													
																																
			this intermediary role and help manage demonstrations 																													
																																
			when significant animosity toward police is anticipated. 																													
																																
			Officer wellness: Demonstrations that target policing 																													
																																
			itself typically result in increased tensions and 																													
																																
			provocations from protestors. Crowd management 																													
																																
			plans for these demonstrations should provide for 																													
																																
			officers to be rotated out more frequently so they can 																													
																																
			rest, have a meal or a snack, and compose themselves 																													
																																
			before resuming their duties.²²

			²² POLICING PROTESTS, supra note 1, at 80; see also PERF 2018 REPORT, supra note 1, at 12.9. Respond proportionally 																													
																																
			During a protest, police action always should seek 																													
																																
			to de-escalate—not elevate—tensions with crowd 																													
																																
			members. Whenever possible, agencies should 																													
																																
			avoid an unnecessarily militarized presence or 																													
																																
			aggressive response. To enable this proportional 																													
																																
			approach, use tiered response plans that increase 																													
																																
			the level of engagement in proportion only to 																													
																																
			actual—not assumed or forecasted—conditions on 																													
																																
			the ground. Response plans should start "soft," 																													
																																
			with officers wearing regular uniforms and 																													
																																
			attempting to engage with the crowd. At this 																													
																																
			stage, any formations that signal the police may 																													
																																
			be preparing to disperse the crowd, such as lines 																													
																																
			or wedges, should be avoided. Officers can 																													
																																
			demonstrate a commitment to facilitation by 																													
																																
			distributing water or face masks to protestors. 																													
																																
			Of course, protests that start peacefully may not 																													
																																
			remain that way, and officer safety is a critical 																													
																																
			concern. If officers are initially deployed in soft 																													
																																
			gear, ensure they have ready access to helmets in 																													
																																
			the event they need to quickly protect themselves 																													
																																
			from head injuries from projectiles or debris. If 																													
																																
			actual violence or property destruction is 																													
																																
			occurring or imminent and officers require 																													
																																
			additional protective gear, agencies may deploy 																													
																																
			bicycle officers as the next phase of a tiered 																													
																																
			response.²³ Bikes provide multiple benefits: they 																													
																																
			are easier to maneuver through a crowd than 																													
																																
			vehicles; officers on bikes are more approachable 																													
																																
			than those in riot gear; and bike helmets provide 																													
																																
			protection without appearing militaristic.²⁴ 																													
																																
			The final stage of a tiered response plan allows 																													
																																
			for officers to deploy in "hard" gear, like riot gear. 																													
																																
			This stage should be considered a last resort, 																													
																																
			authorized only when necessary to protect the 																													
																																
			public or officers from violence or serious injury. In 																													
																																
			case of a violent outbreak, tactical units may be 																													
																																
			staged nearby, but should remain out of sight of 																													
																																
			protestors to avoid escalating a peaceful crowd. If 																													
																																
			a police force is committed to and trained in the 																													
																																
			principles of de-escalation and facilitation, then 																													
																																
			the need to increase the level of the response 																													
																																
			should be the exception rather than the rule. 																													
																																
			10. Target enforcement 																													
																																
			Along with tiered response plans, agencies should 																													
																																
			target enforcement only to those engaging in 																													
																																
			violence, property destruction, or other serious 																													
																																
			crimes. At large protests, taking police action 																													
																																
			against individuals without affecting peaceful 																													
																																
			bystanders will be difficult, and interventions must 																													
																																
			be well-focused and carefully considered. Even 																													
																																
			when enforcement is necessary against particular 																													
																																
			individuals, officers should continue to facilitate 																													
																																
			peaceful protest. Because of the real potential for 																													
																																
			enforcement to escalate a situation, two 																													
																																
			considerations should guide every enforcement 																													
																																
			decision: 																													
																																
			• The likelihood that police action will improve the 																													
																																
			situation; and 																													
																																
			• The seriousness of the offense(s) and the 																													
																																
			objective dangers they present. 																													
																																
			To implement this approach, instruct and train 																													
																																
			officers to distinguish between violent criminal 																													
																																
			behavior 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			lower-level 																													
																																
			acts 																													
																																
			of 																													
																																
			civil 																													
																																
			disobedience. Explain that this strategy requires 																													
																																
			allowing some illegal but nonviolent behavior to 																													
																																
			persist, such as some traffic law violations. It also 																													
																																
			may require issuing citations instead of arrests for

			a broader swath of offenses than typically may 																													
																																
			be permitted.²⁵ Of course, the decision to issue 																													
																																
			citations for an arrest-eligible offense needs to 																													
																																
			be balanced against legitimate concerns that 																													
																																
			individuals will re-engage in the same illegal 																													
																																
			activity.²⁶ Yet policing agencies should make a 																													
																																
			concerted effort to use the least restrictive 																													
																																
			enforcement option at the outset and not 																													
																																
			assume, without an articulable basis, that the 																													
																																
			criminal behavior will continue.²⁷ 																													
																																
			Mass Arrests: Mass arrests should be avoided 																													
																																
			at all costs – they escalate tensions with 																													
																																
			protestors and deplete officer resources at the 																													
																																
			scene.²⁸ In the rare circumstances in which mass 																													
																																
			arrests may be necessary, incident commanders 																													
																																
			should develop a plan that estimates the number 																													
																																
			of anticipated arrests and ensures sufficient 																													
																																
			staffing.²⁹ For spontaneous events, the incident 																													
																																
			commander(s) should assess the scene on the 																													
																																
			ground to determine if additional personnel and 																													
																																
			resources are required.³⁰ 																													
																																
			To enable efficient processing, agencies may 																													
																																
			need to modify their typical arrest procedures to 																													
																																
			expedite processing. For example, agencies can 																													
																																
			develop a shortened intake form or eliminate 																													
																																
			fingerprinting 																													
																																
			for 																													
																																
			non-felony 																													
																																
			offenses.³¹ 																													
																																
			Reducing 																													
																																
			the 																													
																																
			the 																													
																																
			number 																													
																																
			of 																													
																																
			people 																													
																																
			fingerprinted 																													
																																
			during 																													
																																
			a 																													
																																
			protest 																													
																																
			assumes 																													
																																
			heightened relevance during COVID-19 because 																													
																																
			of public health concerns around shared, high																													
																																
			contact surfaces. If it is necessary to obtain 																													
																																
			fingerprints, i.e., when booking someone who’s 																													
																																
			committed a felony, agencies may consider 																													
																																
			using mobile fingerprint technology to expedite 																													
																																
			the process.³² 																													
																																
			Agencies also should develop a high-volume 																													
																																
			processing system that prepares certain district 																													
																																
			houses or mobile facilities with adequate 																													
																																
			resources to process arrests as quickly as 																													
																																
			possible.³³ Individuals subject to arrest should 																													
																																
			be brought to the nearest processing facility.³⁴ 																													
																																
			Transport to a distant location should occur only 																													
																																
			when there is a substantial risk that on-site 																													
																																
			processing would allow the unlawful behavior to 																													
																																
			continue.³⁵ During processing, precautions 																													
																																
			should be taken to ensure that protestors' 																													
																																
			constitutional rights are respected, including 																													
																																
			providing reasonable access to restrooms, 																													
																																
			water, food, and necessary medical attention.³⁶ 																													
																																
			Special care should be taken to ensure that 																													
																																
			vulnerable populations, such as people with 																													
																																
			disabilities or transgender individuals, are 																													
																																
			searched and detained in a respectful manner; 																													
																																
			all effort must be made to provide shelter and 																													
																																
			restroom facilities appropriate to their needs 																													
																																
			and identities. 																													
																																
			Crowd Containment: Indiscriminate crowd 																													
																																
			containment measures should rarely, if ever, be 																													
																																
			used; containment without a point of egress 																													
																																
			should never be permitted. Instead, agencies 																													
																																
			should focus on providing clear, well-spaced 																													
																																
			dispersal orders and isolating actual bad actors 																													
																																
			through a targeted enforcement approach. 																													
																																
			Policing agencies should develop a procedure

			restraints made of plastic or nylon that are an 																													
																																
			economical, disposable alternative to traditional metal 																													
																																
			handcuffs.³⁷ Unlike metal handcuffs, zip ties do not lock 																													
																																
			into a single fixed position when placed on a person’s 																													
																																
			wrists.³⁸ Because of their low cost and light weight, they 																													
																																
			often are used by police to make a large number of 																													
																																
			arrests in a dynamic situation.³⁹ Yet, their flexibility also 																													
																																
			can lead to injury as the cuffs can continue to tighten 																													
																																
			after they’re placed on an individual’s wrists.⁴⁰ Excessive 																													
																																
			tightening and improper use of zip-tie cuffs can cause 																													
																																
			serious pain, bruising, lacerations, and numbness—or even 																													
																																
			permanent nerve damage.⁴¹ 																													
																																
			Because of these known risks, agencies instead should 																													
																																
			consider alternative restraint options, such as tri-fold 																													
																																
			disposable restraints.⁴² Made of plastic and designed for 																													
																																
			use by law enforcement, tri-fold restraints can lock in a 																													
																																
			fitted position on a person’s wrist and thus reduce the 																													
																																
			potential for excessive tightening and subsequent injury.⁴³ 																													
																																
			Require that officers carry flex cutters with them 																													
																																
			whenever they might use zip-tie cuffs.⁴⁴ 																													
																																
			Require officers applying zip-ties to write their badge 																													
																																
			number in permanent marker on the cuffs so that 																													
																																
			supervisors or protestors can hold officers accountable 																													
																																
			for cuffs that are used improperly or maliciously.⁴⁵ 																													
																																
			Explicitly require that arrestees in flex cuffs are 																													
																																
			checked at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes, 																													
																																
			to ensure proper fit. ⁴⁶ 																													
																																
			Although these handcuffs may be more expensive than 																													
																																
			zip-ties, they still are more economical and more practical 																													
																																
			for field use than traditional metal handcuffs.

			Police should avoid kettling, or other restrictive 																													
																																
			containment 																													
																																
			tactics, 																													
																																
			unless 																													
																																
			absolutely 																													
																																
			necessary.⁵¹ Kettling is a crowd control tactic in 																													
																																
			which police confine a group of demonstrators in 																													
																																
			a small area and control access in and out of the 																													
																																
			area. In limited situations, targeted crowd 																													
																																
			containment practices may serve to de-escalate 																													
																																
			potentially violent situations while avoiding police 																													
																																
			use of force.⁵² For example, police may attempt 																													
																																
			to separate and contain actually violent members 																													
																																
			of a crowd as an alternative to arrest or using 																													
																																
			force and/or to prevent a breach of peace from

			THE POLICING PROJECT AT NYU LAW 																													
																																
			11. Communicate transparently (both internally 																													
																																
			and externally) 																													
																																
			During a protest, clear communication reduces 																													
																																
			conflict and promotes safety for officers and 																													
																																
			protestors alike. Internally, officers should have 																													
																																
			access to a dedicated radio line for logistics and 																													
																																
			to communicate needs to command for essentials 																													
																																
			like food, water, or medical attention. 																													
																																
			Policing agencies also should develop external 																													
																																
			communication plans for protestors, the general 																													
																																
			public, 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			the 																													
																																
			media. 																													
																																
			Agencies 																													
																																
			should 																													
																																
			acknowledge the essential roles played by 																													
																																
			journalists and legal observers and ensure their 																													
																																
			access to information and ability to do their jobs 																													
																																
			unobstructed 																													
																																
			absent 																													
																																
			serious 																													
																																
			public 																													
																																
			safety 																													
																																
			concerns. Legal observers should have access to 																													
																																
			areas where arrests are being made unless their 																													
																																
			presence 																													
																																
			would 																													
																																
			in 																													
																																
			fact 																													
																																
			obstruct 																													
																																
			lawful 																													
																																
			enforcement action. Even then, visual access for 																													
																																
			media and legal observers should be preserved. 																													
																																
			To reduce the administrative burden on police and 																													
																																
			remove any appearance of a conflict of interest, 																													
																																
			press credentialing and legal observer registration 																													
																																
			should be handled by a separate agency or neutral 																													
																																
			body. Agencies also should consider maintaining 																													
																																
			an agency press officer in the field to answer 																													
																																
			journalists' questions and address issues raised. 																													
																																
			To communicate with demonstrators, agencies 																													
																																
			should ensure that all announcements or warnings 																													
																																
			are audible and well documented. Agencies should 																													
																																
			implement a clear warning procedure, discussed 																													
																																
			above, that 																													
																																
			requires 																													
																																
			multiple, well-spaced 																													
																																
			warnings in relevant languages before any 																													
																																
			enforcement action.⁶⁴ To inform the general public, 																													
																																
			agencies 																													
																																
			should 																													
																																
			share 																													
																																
			live 																													
																																
			updates 																													
																																
			and 																													
																																
			information on social media during the course of 																													
																																
			an event. For multi-day protests, agencies also 																													
																																
			should share live updates and information on social 																													
																																
			media during the course of an event. For multi-day 																													
																																
			protests, agencies also should conduct daily press 																													
																																
			conferences that share rules of engagement, 																													
																																
			enforcement rationale, and accurate information 																													
																																
			while correcting misinformation.⁶⁵ 																													
																																
			Command should share intelligence with protest 																													
																																
			leaders about outside agitators infiltrating lawfully 																													
																																
			planned protests and demonstrations. Certainly, 																													
																																
			that information will affect the policing agencies’ 																													
																																
			strategy and their operations before and during 																													
																																
			the demonstration. It is plausible that such 																													
																																
			information also may impact protest leaders’ plans, 																													
																																
			communications and safety measures. In the spirit 																													
																																
			of facilitating peaceful protests and protecting 																													
																																
			those who choose to exercise their First 																													
																																
			Amendment rights, agencies should do everything 																													
																																
			in their power to ensure peaceful and lawful 																													
																																
			demonstrations are not thwarted by those with 																													
																																
			ulterior motives. To not share such pertinent 																													
																																
			information not only jeopardizes the demonstration 																													
																																
			and its orderliness but it also jeopardizes the safety 																													
																																
			of the event’s participants. 																													
																																
			Relatedly officers should never attempt to covertly 																													
																																
			infiltrate a group engaged in protest activities 																													
																																
			unless there is reasonable suspicion that the group 																													
																																
			is planning to engage in criminal activity and there 																													
																																
			are no less intrusive investigatory means. 																													
																																
			Undercover police activity at protests can chill First 																													
																																
			Amendment rights and lead to violence.⁶⁶ 																													
																																
			Finally, officer anonymity should be prohibited, with 																													
																																
			badges and nameplates clearly visible at all times. 																													
																																
			As David Couper, the former Madison, Wisconsin 																													
																																
			Chief of Police and a noted expert in protest 																													
																																
			policing has explained, "[a]nonymity or any 																													
																																
			depersonalization of police conducting crowd 																													
																																
			management 																													
																																
			encourages 																													
																																
			negative 																													
																																
			crowd 																													
																																
			behavior. It can also lead to unaccountable 																													
																																
			behavior on the part of the police."⁶⁷ If displaying 																													
																																
			names 																													
																																
			presents 																													
																																
			demonstrated 																													
																																
			harassment 																													
																																
			concerns, officers should be clearly identified with 																													
																																
			numbers. Similarly, police leadership should be 																													
																																
			visible, with on-the-ground command staff 																													
																																
			available to respond to issues raised by protestors.

			1112. Evaluate 																													
																																
			Some of the most important policing work begins 																													
																																
			when a protest ends in the form of internal 																													
																																
			evaluation. For larger demonstrations or those that 																													
																																
			result in violence or uses of force, policing agencies 																													
																																
			should engage in comprehensive after-action 																													
																																
			reviews to understand what went right and what 																													
																																
			could be improved. Ideally, these reports should be 																													
																																
			conducted by a neutral party, such as an Inspector 																													
																																
			General. They should include investigations of all 																													
																																
			uses of force and should contain feedback from 																													
																																
			event organizers, participants, and other affected 																													
																																
			community members to ensure the review 																													
																																
			represents a holistic picture of the event. All 																													
																																
			findings should be made public. 																													
																																
			13. Retrain 																													
																																
			Following these reviews and at regular intervals, 																													
																																
			demonstration training should be re-evaluated 																													
																																
			and updated to reflect lessons learned from 																													
																																
			post-event assessments. 																													
																																
			14. Support 																													
																																
			Finally, officers should be provided with access 																													
																																
			to counseling and peer support as needed in 																													
																																
			the event of violence or other traumatic or 																													
																																
			stressful events during a protest.

			Protests present some of the most complex and challenging situations police face. This guide 																													
																																
			provides strategic and operational recommendations to enable fair and effective policing practices 																													
																																
			before, during, and after these events. Implementing these recommendations should help ensure that

			Dear tshingombe tshingombe,																													
			ISC2 would like to thank you for the time and effort you spent on submitting a proposal for ISC2 Security Congress 2025. We were fortunate to have many strong proposals to choose from, but only a limited number could be selected. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept your submission, "thesis master engineering Thesis master doctoral engineering electrical subject ciriculum framework qualicafition Education technology," at this time.																													
			We received more than 600 proposals this year for 80 available speaking slots, so there were many quality submissions that did not get selected. Submissions went through a lengthy review and rating process involving more than 30 experienced cybersecurity practitioners and subject matter experts. Please note that, given the large volume of submissions, we are unable to provide any further information on why your submission was not accepted.																													
			Again, we thank you for your effort and interest. ISC2 and the Security Congress team appreciate your continued support.

			About SSCP																													
																																
			The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) is the ideal certification for those with proven technical skills and practical, hands-on security knowledge in operational IT roles. It provides confirmation of a practitioner’s ability to implement, monitor and administer IT infrastructure in accordance with information security policies and procedures that ensure data confidentiality, integrity and availability.																													
																																
			The broad spectrum of topics included in the SSCP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) ensure its relevancy across all disciplines in the field of information security. Successful candidates are competent in the following domains:																													
			· Security Concepts and Practices																													
			· Access Controls																													
			· Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis																													
			· Incident Response and Recovery																													
			· Cryptography																													
			· Network and Communications Security																													
			· Systems and Application Security																													
																																
			Experience Requirements																													
																																
			Candidates must have a minimum of one year cumulative work experience in one or more of the domains of the SSCP CBK. A one year prerequisite pathway will be granted for candidates who received a degree (bachelors or masters) in a cybersecurity program.																													
																																
			A candidate that doesn’t have the required experience to become an SSCP may become an Associate of ISC2 by successfully passing the SSCP examination. The Associate of ISC2 will then have two years to earn the one year required experience. You can learn more about SSCP experience requirements and how to account for part-time work and internships at www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP/SSCP-Experience-Requirements.																													
																																
			Accreditation																													
																																
			SSCP is in compliance with the stringent requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024.																													
																																
			Job Task Analysis (JTA)																													
																																
			ISC2 has an obligation to its membership to maintain the relevancy of the SSCP. Conducted at regular intervals, the Job Task Analysis (JTA) is a methodical and critical process of determining the tasks that are performed by security professionals who are engaged in the profession defined by the SSCP. The results of the JTA are used to update the examination. This process ensures that candidates are tested on the topic areas relevant to the roles and responsibilities of today’s practicing information security professionals.

			Python is a fast, platform-agnostic, and easy-to-learn programming language that is suited for beginners and experienced developers alike. Ever since its first release in 1991, Python has had a constant presence in the computer world and has become a go-to language thanks to its easy-to-understand code and versatility. Today, Python can boast a wide array of libraries and frameworks, and they are the cornerstone of fast and easy Python programming—the so-called Pythonic way of development. But like all programming languages, Python is not immune to security threats. Secure coding best practices must be adopted to avoid risks from attackers. In this webinar, we’ll explore Python security best practices that should employed when building secure application.

			• Tier 1: 1 - Health, Public Services and Care 																													
																																
			• Tier 2: 1.4 – Public services 																													
																																
			The Access to HE Diploma (Policing) has been developed in collaboration with the 																													
																																
			Metropolitan Police Service. Whilst the Diploma has been developed in collaboration with 																													
																																
			the Met Police, centres could work with a local police force to deliver this Diploma. 																													
																																
			Diploma aims 																													
																																
			The Access to HE Diploma (Policing) offers adult returners a coherent, integrated and 																													
																																
			supported year of study through which they will gain the knowledge, awareness, skills and 																													
																																
			confidence necessary for successful undergraduate studying in the intended progression 																													
																																
			routes for this Diploma. The course aims to provide a balance of essential study skills with 																													
																																
			specialist subject knowledge to enable the students to be prepared for the academic and 																													
																																
			practical rigours of undergraduate study in HE Policing entry programmes. It must however be 																													
																																
			noted that the Access to HE Diploma does not provide guaranteed entry to UK Higher 																													
																																
			Education Institutions. 																													
																																
			Its primary aims are: 																													
																																
			• To provide HE progression opportunities for adults who, because of social, educational 																													
																																
			or individual circumstances, do not have the necessary qualifications;Access to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025 																													
																																
			3																													
																																
			• To give learners a general introduction to the basic concepts, methods, and key areas 																													
																																
			of knowledge within the core disciplines taken and offer a coherent and stimulating 																													
																																
			framework within which they can broaden their intellectual outlook and make 																													
																																
			connections between subject areas; 																													
																																
			• To help learners to develop and consolidate the various skills required to enable them to 																													
																																
			cope successfully with the demands of undergraduate study and to become 																													
																																
			independent, self-directed learners; 																													
																																
			• To establish a positive and supportive learning environment within which learners can 																													
																																
			build their confidence through successful learning and the sharing of their experience; 																													
																																
			• To provide the personal, educational support (including preparation for application and 																													
																																
			interview techniques) needed to facilitate learners pursuing their aims within the 																													
																																
			framework of the course. 																													
																																
			Target learners 																													
																																
			• Adults who, because of social, educational or individual circumstances, were unable to 																													
																																
			participate in or benefit from initial education. 																													
																																
			• Adults from groups under-represented in higher education. 																													
																																
			• Adults seeking a change of direction because of unemployment or lack of career 																													
																																
			opportunities in their previous field and who have a demonstrable interest in entering a 																													
																																
			Policing career. 																													
																																
			Potential progression routes 																													
																																
			This Diploma has been designed for progression onto the Police Constable Degree 																													
																																
			Apprenticeship and related HE Policing entry degree programmes. 																													
																																
			Entry guidance 																													
																																
			There are no centrally specified formal requirements for qualifications on entry; however there 																													
																																
			is usually the expectation that the learner will have literacy, communication skills and 																													
																																
			numeracy at Level 2 or above. For learners wishing to progress to a Police Constable Degree 																													
																																
			Apprenticeship, Level 2 English is a pre-requisite with an expectation that Level 2 Functional 																													
																																
			Skills Maths will be attained by the end of the first year of the degree apprenticeship. 																													
																																
			Advice and guidance 																													
																																
			Learners should be aware that degrees undertaken via a specific force will be subject to a 																													
																																
			successful application, vetting and offer. 																													
																																
			Centres delivering this Diploma must, as part of advice and guidance, make learners aware that 																													
																																
			they will not be eligible for the Access to HE Diploma loan waiver for their adult learner loan as 																													
																																
			the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship is not eligible for funding under Student Finance 																													
																																
			England. However, learners would be salaried and would not be eligible for any HE fees. Access to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025 																													
																																
			4																													
																																
			Guided learning hours 																													
																																
			The Access to HE Diploma represents 600 notional Guided Learning Hours (GLH) with courses 																													
																																
			generally delivered in 450 GLH. This may vary between centres and may depend on whether the 																													
																																
			course is being delivered through blended learning. It is expected a centre delivering the 																													
																																
			course will clearly outline the intended delivery in terms of total hours and how this is broken 																													
																																
			down weekly over the period of study. 																													
																																
			Diploma resources 																													
																																
			The minimum required resources for this Diploma include: 																													
																																
			• Access to IT facilities with specialist software as appropriate. 																													
																																
			• Access to learning resources and online facilities. 																													
																																
			• Access to VLE or other system, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Classroom. 																													
																																
			• Access to resources for specialist learner support and reasonable adjustments. 																													
																																
			• The same level of facilities and resources should be available at each site where the 																													
																																
			Diploma is delivered. 																													
																																
			Staffing requirements 																													
																																
			• Staff delivering, assessing or internally moderating on the Access to HE course must 																													
																																
			have the professional competence and level of subject expertise necessary to deliver 																													
																																
			and assess the units available on the Diploma. They should be qualified at Level 4 or 																													
																																
			above in the named subject, or in a discipline that includes the subject. For example, a 																													
																																
			tutor with a Social Science degree may be able to teach both Psychology and Sociology. 																													
																																
			• Staff should have or be working towards a teaching qualification. 																													
																																
			• Staff should have knowledge and understanding of the Access to HE Diploma, including 																													
																																
			QAA regulations, AVA assessment regulations, the QAA Grading Scheme and the Rules 																													
																																
			of Combination. 																													
																																
			• New staff should be inducted to ensure that they have sufficient information to deliver, 																													
																																
			assess or internally moderate on the Diploma competently. 																													
																																
			• It is desirable that teachers have personal practice experience. 																													
																																
			Assessment 																													
																																
			Grading Standards 																													
																																
			The graded units in an Access to HE Diploma are graded using a scheme which has been 																													
																																
			designed to accommodate the flexibility of the qualification (it can be applied to all Access to 																													
																																
			HE Diploma graded units, whatever their subject or structure). A grade of Pass, Merit or 																													
																																
			Distinction is awarded for every graded Level 3 unit that a learner completes successfully as 																													
																																
			part of an Access to HE Diploma. Grades can only be awarded for graded units which are part of Access to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025 																													
																																
			5																													
																																
			the Diploma (and conform to the Rules of Combination). There is no overall grade for the 																													
																																
			Diploma. 																													
																																
			There are 3 grading standards which are applied to all graded units: 																													
																																
			GS1: Knowledge and Understanding 																													
																																
			GS2: Subject Specific Skills 																													
																																
			GS3: Transferable Skills 																													
																																
			Each grading standard comprises of a set of components and sub-components which describe 																													
																																
			types of performance associated with the standard. For each component, there are parallel 																													
																																
			statements at merit and distinction, which describe increasingly demanding standards of 																													
																																
			achievement. The most appropriate sub-components of the standards are selected when 																													
																																
			grading the unit. 																													
																																
			For Grading Standard 3: Transferable Skills, all three of the components (a, b and c) must be 																													
																																
			used at least once across the Diploma. 																													
																																
			For further information can be found here on the OCN London website. 																													
																																
			Assessment mechanisms 																													
																																
			The Access to HE Diploma assessment mechanism incorporates: 																													
																																
			• Assessment tasks which are designed and set by the Centre 																													
																																
			• Internal assessment of learner work 																													
																																
			• Internal and external moderation of assessment. 																													
																																
			There are no additional external assessments for this Diploma. 																													
																																
			Recommended methods of assessment 																													
																																
			The recommended assessment methods for this Diploma should include a variety of methods 																													
																																
			which take into consideration the target learners for this Diploma and the appropriateness for 																													
																																
			the units being assessed. Assessment methods should be valid, reliable, and inclusive and 																													
																																
			assure equity. 																													
																																
			The following assessment methods could be used to assess the units within this Diploma. 																													
																																
			Please note, it is expected that at least part of one unit is assessed by formal examination 																													
																																
			taken under timed conditions. 																													
																																
			• Case studies 																													
																																
			• Oral presentation 																													
																																
			• Practical tasks/demonstrationsAccess to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025

			3																													
																																
			I am looking for someone outstanding to join my team who can help us manage the daily 																													
																																
			challenges London poses, and who can also drive the change necessary for the Met to keep 																													
																																
			pace with this vibrant city. London is a fantastic place and I have always been incredibly 																													
																																
			proud to serve the capital. It is a diverse, growing and ever-changing city with national 																													
																																
			impact and international reach. 																													
																																
			How the Met operates has changed significantly in recent years, achieving a step change in 																													
																																
			effectiveness, efficiency and confidence. But the scale of our ambition for the future is even 																													
																																
			greater. It has to be. 																													
																																
			There are many challenges facing policing. I have no doubt the Met can meet them all – to 																													
																																
			transform, to exploit the opportunities of the digital age, to get the best from our people and 																													
																																
			most importantly to make London the safest it can be. 																													
																																
			The Mayor has set out his priorities in his Police and Crime Plan – a bold and challenging 																													
																																
			agenda with a focus on priorities. My particular focus is to bear down on violence in all its 																													
																																
			forms, protecting the vulnerable and the security of our city. I want us to become even 																													
																																
			closer to our communities, building confidence and trust. 																													
																																
			One of my central aims for the Met is that we are a modern police service, but with the best 																													
																																
			of policing’s traditional values at our core. To do that we need every single part of the force 																													
																																
			to be well led, every officer and staff member to feel supported and to have the right 																													
																																
			equipment to help them serve London. 																													
																																
			I want all our people to believe in the Met and the tangible difference they make every day 																													
																																
			across the city so that we can become even better at keeping London safe. I want the public 																													
																																
			to believe in us too and so I want us to be more transparent about what we do on their 																													
																																
			behalf.INTRODUCTION FROM THE COMMISSIONER 																													
																																
			4																													
																																
			Our values of courage, compassion, integrity and professionalism remain at the heart of 																													
																																
			everything we do. My commitment to you is to lead the Met in a way that respects and nurtures 																													
																																
			these very traditional values but which also puts us at the forefront of modern policing and 																													
																																
			maintains Scotland Yard’s well-earned international reputation. 																													
																																
			This information pack will give you further insight into the role, and the qualities and experience 																													
																																
			we are looking for. 																													
																																
			I very much hope you will be inspired by this opportunity to serve with the Met. 																													
																																
			Cressida Dick CommissionerABOUT THE MET 																													
																																
			5																													
																																
			Founded by Sir Robert Peel in 1829, the Metropolitan Police Service (the Met) is one of the 																													
																																
			oldest police services in the world. From the beginning, the purpose of the Met has been to 																													
																																
			serve and protect the people of London by providing a professional police service. This remains 																													
																																
			our purpose. 																													
																																
			Our vision is to make London the safest global city, a city in which people are free to be 																													
																																
			themselves, express themselves and flourish. We strive to earn the trust and confidence of 																													
																																
			every community and take pride in the quality of our service so that people love, respect and 																													
																																
			are proud of London’s Metropolitan Police. 																													
																																
			The Met is responsible for maintaining the peace and is accountable in law for the exercise of 																													
																																
			policing powers, and to the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) for the delivery of 																													
																																
			efficient and effective policing, management of resources and expenditure. At all times the 																													
																																
			Commissioner and her officers remain operationally independent, in the service of the public. 																													
																																
			The Met ‘New Scotland Yard’ is internationally recognised for its history, law enforcement and 																													
																																
			skills in fighting crime, however a constantly changing city needs an accessible police service 																													
																																
			which reflects and understands the people it serves. It needs an effective police service 																													
																																
			equipped for the 21st century with a visible service which every day continues to earn the trust 																													
																																
			and confidence of Londoners. 																													
																																
			Today, the Met is made up of more than 39,000 officers and staff, plus thousands of volunteers; 																													
																																
			we are one of the largest employers in London and the South East of England. The territory we 																													
																																
			serve covers 620 square miles and is home to over 8.6 million people. The Met is the UK’s 																													
																																
			largest police service and has 25% of the total police budget for England and Wales. 																													
																																
			We’re proud that the Met is seen as a world leader in policing. The ‘Scotland Yard’ brand is 																													
																																
			known around the world as a symbol of quality investigation and traditional values of policing. 																													
																																
			Thanks to this reputation, our services are highly sought after, either through using our officers 																													
																																
			and staff in operational matters or by training others and giving them the opportunity to learn 																													
																																
			from our experiences.ABOUT THE MET 																													
																																
			6																													
																																
			LONDON: THE AMAZING GLOBAL CITY WE POLICE 																													
																																
			London is unique: ‘the world under one roof’. 																													
																																
			Its ever-changing population is set to grow towards 9.2 million by 2020 and exceed 10 million the 																													
																																
			following decade. It is probably one of themost diverse cities in the world. The complexities of 																													
																																
			policing a city on this scale are huge. A seat of Parliamentary, Royal and Diplomatic power, London is 																													
																																
			a centre for protest, for criminality, for transport. 																													
																																
			Londoners tend to be younger than the rest of the UK, more than three million of us were born 																													
																																
			abroad, just under half of which arrived in the UK less than 10 years ago. 																													
																																
			London is also the world’s most popular business and travel destination, receiving 																													
																																
			31.5 million Visits in 2015, 12.9 million from the UK. It is a global city, recognised around the world, 																													
																																
			economically, politically, financially and creatively. London’s greatness comes from its openness to 																													
																																
			the world, and this in turn has helped build world-renowned institutions which have preserved its 																													
																																
			safety and stability. 																													
																																
			There are over 200 languages spoken in London, and around 40% of the population is Black or 																													
																																
			Minority Ethnic (BAME). These numbers are predicted to grow further as the city expands and 																													
																																
			develops as an international centre. 																													
																																
			Of the six largest world faiths, almost four million Christians and onemillion Muslims live in London, 																													
																																
			and Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Sikhism each have more than 80,000 followers in the capital. 																													
																																
			London’s population swells due to an influx of commuters during the day and tourists throughout 																													
																																
			the year - in greater volumes than anywhere else in the UK. 																													
																																
			London is one of the safest global cities in the world already. Nevertheless, criminality within 																													
																																
			London is on a more prevalent and serious level than other cities and communities across England & 																													
																																
			Wales. Crime in the capital is often connected to organised criminality and national and 																													
																																
			international networks of offending. London has, throughout our lifetime, been a place that 																													
																																
			terrorists want to attack. 																													
																																
			This creates a unique policing environment. Everyone joining us needs the ability to deliver 																													
																																
			outstanding policing to the communities of London.ABOUT THE MET 																													
																																
			7																													
																																
			WE HAVE A HIGHLY AMBITIOUS TRANSFORMATION AGENDA 																													
																																
			Our transformation programme 																													
																																
			Like many public bodies, we work with constrained resources, increasing demand and a changing 																													
																																
			environment that require us to make policing in London ever more effective. Recognising the 																													
																																
			challenges and the opportunities to improve our services, we are currently in the midst of one of 																													
																																
			the biggest transformation programmes of any public sector organisation. 																													
																																
			Our Transformation Portfolio aims to deliver transformation right across our functions and 																													
																																
			departments, to modernise the force as a whole, and keep our resources focused on priority 																													
																																
			areas, providing an effective and efficient service to all Londoners. 																													
																																
			In the past twelve months we have delivered: 																													
																																
			· A more visible neighbourhood presence, with about 1,700 dedicated officers whose sole 																													
																																
			focus is to respond to the issues that matter to local communities (two police constables 																													
																																
			(PCs) as Dedicated Ward Officers (DWOs), and one Police Community Support Officer 																													
																																
			(PCSO) in all 629 London wards). These officers are tackling local priorities and anti-social 																													
																																
			behaviour, identifying people vulnerable to, or at risk of becoming involved in crime, and 																													
																																
			solving local issues. 																													
																																
			· A strengthened local police. By regrouping a small number of boroughs to deliver core 																													
																																
			local policing functions (neighbourhoods, safeguarding, response and investigation) 																													
																																
			across borough boundaries, we can integrate and enhance our capability, and improve the 																													
																																
			safeguarding of vulnerable people with more officers dedicated to prevention. 																													
																																
			Management costs will reduce, which means we can maximise the availability of officers 																													
																																
			on the frontline. People, buildings, technology and fleet currently in one borough will be 																													
																																
			shared across a Basic Command Unit (BCU), making it easier to provide resources in line 																													
																																
			with each local area’s peaks in demand. In addition, we have opened up access to a police 																													
																																
			career through direct entry superintendents, inspectors and detectives, attracting a 																													
																																
			diverse pool of applicants who may not have otherwise considered a career in policing. 																													
																																
			· Significant enhancements to our service. Our new website offers relevant local 																													
																																
			information and prevention advice. It is includes online crime reporting capability: 11 per 																													
																																
			cent of crimes are now reported online. A new Telephone and Digital Investigation Unit 																													
																																
			complements this, reducing demand on our response teams, allowing them to focus their 																													
																																
			efforts more effectively. Body Worn Video (BWV) cameras were rolled out to over 22,000 																													
																																
			officers, more than any other police service in the world. By being the first British police 																													
																																
			service to share footage digitally with the criminal justice service, we have improved 																													
																																
			security, reduced the demand on officer time and saved £3.5 million per year in operating 																													
																																
			costs. Complaints and investigations can become more evidence-based with supporting 																													
																																
			BWV material. ABOUT THE MET 																													
																																
			8																													
																																
			· Smarter Working bringing a significant range of savings and qualitative benefits, 																													
																																
			including improved morale, officer visibility and service effectiveness and efficiency. As a 																													
																																
			result of the rollout of 30,000 tablet and mobile devices, we have the ability over time to 																													
																																
			support our officers with better applications so they spend more time visibly assisting the 																													
																																
			public and less time in our buildings; we also expect to be able to better serve the public, 																													
																																
			with our officers having access to the right information at the time when they need it. 																													
																																
			We have a clear roadmap that sets out our transformation plans to 2020. We have reviewed our 																													
																																
			processes and capabilities, our organisational, technological and digital strengths and 																													
																																
			weaknesses; and are constantly assessing future demand and current gaps to identify where 																													
																																
			change is necessary, where investments are required, and where benefits can be realised. 																													
																																
			We need to make further savings, whilst continuing to improve our operational effectiveness and 																													
																																
			efficiency in the face of increasing overall demand, higher expectations from the public and the 																													
																																
			added complexity of a digital age. 																													
																																
			Technology and estate transformation are some of the key enablers of that change, but 																													
																																
			organisational culture and learning, and good information management are also vital to make it a 																													
																																
			success. ABOUT THE MET

			For London… 																													
																																
			A modern, transformed and more efficient Met will Protect London by investing more ofits time 																													
																																
			on the areasof greatestthreat, risk and harm; 																													
																																
			We will make every community safer through our new neighbourhood policing service anda 																													
																																
			stronger focuson safeguardingtoprotectthe mostvulnerable. 																													
																																
			For Our People… 																													
																																
			We will provide real time information to keep them safe and manage risk, and provide 																													
																																
			professional support so they can concentrate on their job; 																													
																																
			We will deliver a digital service from contact to court to help meet demand, and trust in them to 																													
																																
			do their job well and have good professional judgement so their time is spent on activities that 																													
																																
			have the most impact.CORPORATE PRIORITIES 																													
																																
			10																													
																																
			Our mission is to keep London safe for everyone 																													
																																
			To achieve this, we will: 																													
																																
			Focus on what matters most to Londoners 																													
																																
			Violent crime tops the public’s concerns and tackling it is our top priority. This includes terrorism, 																													
																																
			knife and gun crime, sexual offending, domestic abuse and safeguarding vulnerable people from 																													
																																
			predatory behaviour. 																													
																																
			Mobilise partners and the public 																													
																																
			We know that safety requires action and intervention beyond the police service. We will work 																													
																																
			with partners and communities to help keep them safe and support them in preventing crime. 																													
																																
			We will work harder to earn the trust of more young people and ethnic minority communities. 																													
																																
			Achieve the best outcomes in the pursuit of justice and in the support of victims 																													
																																
			We have a fundamental responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that victims 																													
																																
			receive the best possible outcome. We will do this by catching offenders and by ensuring victims 																													
																																
			of crime receive both justice and the support they need from us and our partners. 																													
																																
			As an organisation, we want to lead 21st century policing and: 																													
																																
			Seize the opportunities of data and digital tech to become a world leader in policing 																													
																																
			We want to harness data and use advanced technologies to our advantage in the pursuit of criminals, 																													
																																
			rising to the challenge of a fast-moving data-driven digital age. We will make information and insight more 																													
																																
			accessible internally, and externally, to support evidence-based decisions and promote public confidence. 																													
																																
			We will strive to enhance our global reputation for excellence and expertise in policing.11BACKGROUND 																													
																																
			12																													
																																
			The MPS Assessment Centre deals with the interviewing and assessment for all posts where we 																													
																																
			recruit in large volumes. This involves assessments for new Police Officers, Police Community 																													
																																
			Support Officers, Special Constables, Designated Detention Officers, as well as the recruitment 																													
																																
			of new Detectives. 																													
																																
			Every role will have a slightly different assessment process, based on job specifications. This will 																													
																																
			range from an interview and written test, to a half-day assessment including interview, role 																													
																																
			plays, interactive and video based scenarios. 																													
																																
			We assess both Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers to the National 																													
																																
			assessment standard. This National standard is a Home Office regulation for Police Officers, so 																													
																																
			every force in the country must recruit to this level. Only assessors that have been trained to the 																													
																																
			National Standard, may undertake this kind of assessment. The training course is delivered over 																													
																																
			a 4 day period and takes place at our Assessment Centre premises in West Brompton, London. 																													
																																
			Primarily, this is where our Community Assessors are used. 																													
																																
			With the introduction in 2018 of a refreshed police Recruitment process called Day One, which 																													
																																
			incorporates IT for candidates and assessors use, all assessors will be required to be comfortable 																													
																																
			with the use of technology in the assessment process. All training is provided on using the tech, 																													
																																
			as well as the assessment material. 																													
																																
			After successful completion of the Community Assessor training course, assessors will then be 																													
																																
			offered work on a causal basis. Assessment activity will fluctuate dependent on the Recruitment 																													
																																
			activity taking place and their availability. It is a flexible role and is designed to enable assessors 																													
																																
			the ability to work assessing around other responsibilities. Based on demand community 																													
																																
			assessors may assess from between 2-3 days a week to a couple of days a month. 																													
																																
			It is possible that once a Community Assessor has gained experience in the National method of 																													
																																
			assessment, that if they are suitable, further training may be offered to participate in other kinds 																													
																																
			of interviews (for example Detectives and Police Community Support Officers). There is also the 																													
																																
			opportunity to develop further in the role, with the Quality Assurance role, or delivering training. 																													
																																
			It is important we have a team of professionally trained assessors to support our recruitment 																													
																																
			assessments. Bringing with you a variety of different experience and to reflect the diversity of 																													
																																
			the communities we serve.COMMUNITY ASSESSORS -PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK

Secondly, by erroneously finding that the appellant's alleged denial of the respondent's version of events bears no evidential weight and falls to be rejected.

			Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI Act)																													
			Welcome to the Protection of Personal Information Act (often called the POPI Act or POPIA) in the form of a website so everyone can access it quickly on all devices. It is so much better than a POPI Act pdf. You can also link to (or share) a specific section. We hope it empowers you and you find it helpful. This is POPIA (or the POPI Act) as enacted by the South African Parliament, but we have reformatted it in the form of a website. The English text was signed by the President. We have shortened the names of some chapters in the navigation on the left to make it easier for you to navigate. We disclaim all liability.																													
			You can read a summary of POPIA, attend a POPI workshop, read POPIA judgments and cases, get a POPIA compliance framework or join a Data Protection Programme and working through the POPIA lens to help you take the necessary action to comply.																													
			Please note that we are not the Information Regulator who regulates POPIA. You can visit their website or email them. 																													
			The commencement date of POPIA																													
			It was 1 July 2020 and the one year grace period to comply ended on 30 June 2021. Parliament assented to POPIA on 19 November 2013. The commencement date of section 1, Part A of Chapter 5, section 112 and section 113 was 11 April 2014. The commencement date of the other sections was 1 July 2020 (with the exception of section 110 and 114(4). The President of South Africa has proclaimed the POPI commencement date to be 1 July 2020.

			PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACT (POPIA) – AN EMPLOYER’S PERSPECTIVE																													
			by Jan Truter | May 11, 2021 | 0 comments																													
			Purposes of the Act																													
			The Protection of Personal Information Act of 2013 (POPIA) follows the example of similar, quite onerous legislation in the European Union aimed at protecting individuals’ right to privacy. More specifically, the Act aims to give effect to the right to privacy as provided for in the Constitution’s Bill of Rights by limiting the extent to which personal information may be processed by others, including employers.																													
			Personal information is defined as information that relates to a natural or juristic person (such as a company). This includes, e.g., someone’s physical address, email address, date of birth, ID number, race, gender but also their criminal, financial and employment history, personal opinions or beliefs, trade union membership, etc.																													
			Some personal information is designated as special information, that is, personal information relating to information concerning children; religious or philosophical beliefs; race or ethnic origin; trade union membership; political persuasion; health, sex life or biometric data of a data subject (finger printing, blood typing, voice recognition); and criminal behaviour in certain instances.																													
			Processing refers to the handling of personal information, e.g., the collection, recording, storing, updating or distribution thereof.																													
			Impact on the employment relationship																													
			In the employment context POPIA covers all personal and special personal information that an employer (referred to as a ‘responsible party’) might have about job applicants, employees and former employees (referred to as ‘data subjects’). The Act imposes several new responsibilities on employers:																													
			· Employers must appoint an information officer who needs to be registered with the Regulator.																													
			· Personal Information may, subject to certain exceptions, only be collected by an employer directly from the employee.																													
			· Employees must be informed why the information must be collected (purpose) and who the intended recipients of the information are.																													
			· Personal Information may only be processed for an explicit, specific and lawful purpose (such as the conclusion of an employment contract).																													
			· Personal information may not be kept for longer than necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. This means, e.g., that personal information collected from an unsuccessful applicant should be destroyed after the recruitment process has been finalised and a successful candidate appointed.																													
			· Personal Information must be distributed in a way that is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.																													
			· Personal Information may not be distributed to other third parties, e.g., for instance for marketing purposes.																													
			· Employers must take reasonable steps to ensure that the information collected is accurate, up to date and complete.																													
			· Employers must ensure that the personal information is protected against risks of loss, damage, destruction or unauthorised access.																													
			· Employees must also be allowed to access their personal information and can demand that the information be corrected if it is found to be inaccurate.																													
			When may personal information be processed?																													
			The Act provides for limited use of employee data in some cases, i.e.:																													
			· If the employee consents;																													
			· When processing is necessary for purposes of employment, e.g. details of banking accounts in order to be able to pay an employees’ wage or salary; or for vetting relevant educational qualifications;																													
			· If the employer has a legal obligation to perform processing, e.g., for tax purposes;																													
			· To protect a legitimate interest of the employee’s, e.g., collecting personal information required by a retirement fund to which the employee belongs or is required to belong; and																													
			· If it is necessary to pursue the legitimate interests of the employer or a third party, e.g., doing a check on the criminal record of someone who requires security clearance; or providing information to an external party whom the employee has authorised to carry out deductions from her or his wage or salary.																													
			Special personal information																													
			Additional protections apply to special personal information. This may only be processed if :																													
			· The processing is carried out with the consent of the employee (written consent is not required but is advisable);																													
			· The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a right or obligation in law;																													
			· The processing is necessary to comply with an obligation of international public law;																													
			· The processing is necessary for historical, statistical or research purposes if this serves a public interest (e.g., disease control); or																													
			· The information has deliberately been made public by the employee, e.g. on social media.																													
			What about medical testing?																													
			Medical testing of employees can yield particularly sensitive information about employees. The Act mirrors section 23 of the Employment Equity Act which permits medical testing only if it is required or permitted by legislation or if it can be justified in the light of medical facts, employment conditions, social policy, or the fair distribution of employee benefits or the inherent requirements of the job. Testing for an employee’s HIV status is prohibited unless authorised by the Labour Court. Psychological testing and other similar assessments (such as psychometric tests) are also prohibited unless certain requirements are met, i.e., the test has been scientifically proven to be valid and reliable and that it can be applied fairly to all employees and is not biased against any employee or group of employees.																													
			Rights of employees in respect of their personal information																													
			Employees have the right to be notified by their employer that their personal information will be collected or has been accessed or acquired by an unauthorised person, i.e., someone who does not have consent to process the information. They also have the right to establish what information an employer holds and to request access to such information; to request the correction, destruction or deletion of personal information; to object on reasonable grounds to the processing of his/her personal information; and the right to submit a complaint to the Regulator or institute civil proceedings to protect their rights under the Act.																													
			Consequences of non-compliance																													
			The Act provides that employers can be fined between R1 million and R10 million, or imprisonment for one to ten years depending on the nature and seriousness of a transgression.																													
			Some practical recommendations																													
			Employers would be well advised to attend to the following:																													
			1. Appoint an information officer or assign someone to take on this responsibility. It goes without saying that this person needs to become familiar with the broad purposes of the Act and their responsibilities in terms of it.																													
			2. Develop a privacy policy or data privacy statement that: 																													
			o mentions the circumstances under which personal information may be collected and what may it be used for;																													
			o states what kinds of personal information may be collected; to which internal and external recipients or categories of recipients personal information may be supplied;																													
			o states whether the information may be distributed or stored outside of the country’s borders; and																													
			o includes a general description of the of information security measures (such as fire walls) that will be implemented and monitored to ensure that the information is not accessible by unauthorised people.																													
			3. Review or develop standard clauses on data protection in employment contracts and provide for employee consent to disclosure of information as authorised in terms of the Act.																													
			4. Conduct an audit in respect of personal information currently being held, where such information is being held and for how long it has been held.																													
			5. Raise awareness within the organisation of the implications of the Act and the importance of protecting privacy.																													
			6. Report data breaches to the Information Regulator and employees concerned.																													
			7. Do not share any personal information unless it would be permissible to do so in terms of the Act.																													
			Implementation																													
			Employers need to be compliant by no later than 30 June 2021, when the Act will come fully into effect. An organisation’s Information Officer should be able to register with the Information Regulator any time from 1 May 2021.																													
			Conclusion																													
			While the Act seems very long-winded and makes for difficult reading, it should not be too difficult for employers to comply. There are several steps that need to be taken, but these should be relatively easy to implement. The approach that an employer takes, may vary depending on the nature and size of the																													
			With the emergence of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard Trial saga, domestic violence has never been more prevalent. South Africa, a country where the right to be safe and free is enshrined in our Constitution. The judicial system encompasses 2 types of Protection Orders 1. the Domestic Violence Act 116 of 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘DPO’) and 2. the Protection from Harassment Act 17 of 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘HPO’). It is important to understand which Act has authority in which instance.																													
			Be advised that an Interim Protection Order or a Final Protection Order only comes into effect when personally served upon the alleged abuser by either the sheriff of the Court or a Police official.																													
			DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ORDER:																													
			A Protection Order is an order issued by a court ordering a person with whom one has or has had a domestic relationship (the Respondent), to stop the abuse. This includes a roommate who shared a common residence. It’s a legal document issued by a Magistrate in the jurisdiction area in which the abuse occurred that specifies the conditions that an abuser must adhere to, as specified by the courts.																													
			HARRASMENT PROTECTION ORDER:																													
			A Protection Order is an order issued by a court ordering a person with whom one is not in a domestic relationship i.e., a neighbour (the Respondent) and who doesn’t share a common residence, to stop the harassment or abuse. It’s a legal document issued by a Magistrate in the jurisdiction area in which the abuse occurred that specifies the conditions that an abuser must adhere to, as specified by the courts.																													
			DO I QUALIFY FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ORDER?																													
			The conditions for a Protection Order in terms of domestic/gender base violence are as follows:																													
			1. There must be a pattern of abuse i.e., repetitive actions.																													
			2. It must be a form of domestic violence which includes but are not limited to:																													
			1. Physical violence,																													
			2. Sexual violence,																													
			3. Financial abuse, and																													
			4. Emotional/verbal violence.																													
			1. The order may also prohibit the Respondent from:																													
			1. enlisting the help of another person to commit any such act;																													
			2. entering a residence shared by a complainant and the Respondent or a specified part of the shared residence or the victims place of employment or where the victim resides; committing any other act as specified in the protection order including an order to seize any firearms or dangerous weapon from the Respondent; or																													
			3. financially threatening the victim by making monetary relief available to the victim.

			1. No pattern is needed, and a first offence can be sufficient for a Harassment Order.																													
			2. No relationship is required, and it can be against someone you don’t even know.																													
			3. No violence is required.																													
			4. It must be a form of harassment which includes but are not limited to:																													
			1. messaging,																													
			2. unwanted packages,																													
			3. letters, psychological harm,																													
			4. physical harm, and																													
			5. financial harm.																													
			1. The order may also prohibit the Respondent from:																													
			1. To cease and desists with his/her stalking, harassing behaviour or enlisting the help of another person to commit any such act.																													
			HOW DO I OBTAIN A PROTECTION ORDER?																													
			The following procedure has been established to obtain a Protection Order:																													
			1. OBTAINING AND COMPLETING:																													
			For a Domestic Violence Application, one will need to obtain a Domestic Violence Act Form 2 and complete the Form 2 as accurate as possible supported by an Affidavit setting out in detail what the Respondent did and on what date this incidents happened. 																													
			For a Harassment Protection Application, one will need to obtain the Protection against Harassment Act Form 2 and complete the Form 2 as accurate as possible supported by an Affidavit setting out in detail what the Respondent did and on what date this incidents happened.																													
			Any victim of domestic/gender-based violence is advised to first register a criminal case at their local police station. In doing so it supports the application for a protection order.																													
			Requesting a protection order doesn't mean that you're laying a charge against your abuser. However, if you're a victim of a type of domestic abuse that's also a crime, then you can apply for a protection order, lay a criminal charge, or both. Some examples of abuse that are also crimes include common assault, rape, incest, attempted murder, and the abuse of animals.																													
			2. DISCRETION OF THE COURT TO GRANT AN INTERIM ORDER: 																													
			Before obtaining a protection order, you need to apply for an interim protection order first. A magistrate court will consider the application. The court in its discretion will issue an interim protection order after a court date has been issued to the Respondent. 																													
			3. SERVICE UPON RESPONDENT:																													
			An interim protection order will be granted and will then be served to the Respondent. The interim order specifies the date at which the final order will be considered. Only once the final order is made, it will be permanent and can only be changed by applying to the courts.																													
			4. RESPONSE BY THE RESPONDENT:																													
			The Respondent will now have an opportunity to file and serve an answering affidavit upon the complainant and the Court if the Application is opposed. If the Respondent decides not to oppose the Application, no further action is needed. 																													
			5. GRANTING A FINAL ORDER:																													
			A court proceeding or hearing of evidence will determine whether a final protection order should be granted.																													
			6. CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RESPONDENT:																													
			Consequences for the Respondent if he/she violates the conditions of the final protection order. If your abuser breaches, or breaks the conditions of the protection order, the complainant/victim is obliged to go to the police station and open a criminal case. The complainant must file an affidavit and in an explicit manner and include all forms and dates of abuse in the affidavit. The Respondent will then be criminally charged with contempt of court. This applies even if the breach is not an actual crime, such as controlling behaviour. If the breach itself involves a crime, such as assault, then the abuser can be charged with both contempt of court and assault.																													
			If your abuser is found guilty of breaking the conditions of a protection order in a criminal case, he or she can be fined or sentenced to prison for not more than 5 years.																													
			To be successful in obtaining a Protection Order, one must note the dates, time and place where the harassment or abuse took place and thus documenting the abuse thoroughly as this will give the presiding officer the necessary evidence to grant an Interim Order against the Abuser. One should further avoid using a Protection Order maliciously, unreasonably and or vexatiously to obtain an upper hand in a litigation matter. If proven that one acted unreasonably, vexatiously and or maliciously an appropriate cost order will be granted against such a party.
